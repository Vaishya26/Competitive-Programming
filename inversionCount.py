# Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. 
# If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
# For example two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
